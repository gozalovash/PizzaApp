# Pizza APP :pizza:
## About the app 
Hi adventurer!:wink: Welcome to the first and best Pizza app of the Hogwarts!:yum: The app was developed as a university project to work with Tkinter framework and learn basics of database management. Continue to explore the app further!    
## Install and run 
Yeap, I study at the wizards' school, but there is no magic used in the app. To install, just repeat the steps::point_down:  
 - Clone the repo:  
`> git clone https://github.com/gozalovash/CanSat.git`  
 - Install requirements  
`> pip install -r requirements.txt`  
 - Run Pizza.py  
`> python .\Main.py`  
## Notes 
The app was developed during the worldwide pandemic of 2020 (due to Covid 19 :mask:), so the delivery part was skipped. Instead, the Vanishing Cabinets were used to transport Pizza from the store to the house of the wizard:european_castle:. Unfortunately, if you are a muggle you will not have the delivery working for you :( Good news is that we are working on that!:crystal_ball:
## Have fun! Enjoy your Magical Pizza!:pizza:    
Love, Hermione Granger :sparkling_heart:
