# Pizza APP  
## About the app  
Hi adventurer! Welcome to the first and best Pizza app of the Hogwarts! The app was developed as a university project to work with Tkinter framework and learn basics of database management. Continue to explore the app further!  
## Install and run  
Yeap, I study at the wizards' school, but there is no magic used in the app. Tu install, just repeat the steps:  
 - Clone the repo:
`> git clone https://github.com/gozalovash/CanSat.git`
 - Install requirements
`> pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Run Pizza.py
`> python .\Main.py`
## Notes  
The app was developed during the worldwide pandemic of 2020 (due to Covid 19), so the delivery part was skipped. Instead, the Vanishing Cabinets were used to transport Pizza from the store to the house of the wizard. Unfortunately, if you are a muggle you will not have the delivery working for you :( Good news is that we are working on that!  
## Have fun!  
Enjoy your Magical Pizza!  
Love, Hermione Granger
